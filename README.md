# Quantum-Magneto-Straintronics-Transport-in-Graphene-A-Realistic-Model
In this repository, I add the codes me and my supervisor Dr. Alexandre Champagne (Concordia University) developed to investigate quantum-magneto-straintronics transport in monolayer graphene devices. Please, make sure that any progress you make based on these codes properly cites us.
